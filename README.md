Analyzing Fatal Encounters in the U.S. Using Python
This report presents a data-driven analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States, focusing on key demographic patterns such as gender, age, and race. The dataset used for this analysis—df_fatalities—compiles verified instances of individuals fatally shot by law enforcement officers while on duty.
Law enforcement-related fatalities are a major public concern in the U.S., raising questions about policing practices, accountability, and the demographic disparities in the use of deadly force. By examining this dataset, we aim to gain insights into:
Gender disparities in fatal police encounters
Age distribution and how manner of death varies by gender
Race-based trends in fatalities
Statistical distribution of ages through histogram and KDE plots
This exploratory data analysis uses various visualizations—including bar charts, box plots, and histograms—to highlight trends and potential biases. Our ultimate goal is to provide a clear, fact-based picture of these events to support informed discussions and policymaking.
